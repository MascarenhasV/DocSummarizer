Node.js Document Summary Statistics Application

# Task:
Utilize Node.js to create a simple command line application that provides summary statistics for a given dataset.

The application will take the relative path to a text file (.txt) as a command line argument. The application then processes the text file to generate the following descriptive statistics about the document:
1.	The number of words in the document
2.	The number of lines
3.	A list of all the words with the count of their occurrence, in descending order
4.	A list of the ten most common trigrams
5.	A listing of the edit distances between the most common trigram and the next ten most common trigrams, in order of distance value. This includes the trigrams being compared and the edit distance value.
